		<h3>Mood Lifter</h3>
		<p>I've found that I enjoy studying more if I can keep a good mood and a positive attitude. Most of the time listening to music <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Music-Fclef.svg/100px-Music-Fclef.svg.png"> really lifts my mood. Here's a quote from an article in The Guardian published in August of 2016 called "Does Music Really Help you concentrate"</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/20/does-music-really-help-you-concentrate">"Some people argue that one of the best music genres for concentration is the video game soundtrack. This makes sense, when you consider the purpose of the video game music: to help create an immersive environment and to facilitate but not distract from a task that requires constant attention and focus."</blockquote>
		<p>You can find many videos on YouTube like this one, of hours of nothing but background music, usually with some kind of related picture or animation as the video content.</p>
